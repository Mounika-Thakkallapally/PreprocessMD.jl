Medically-informed data preprocessing for machine learning

Development is active on https://github.com/AshlinHarris/MLDemo. Once medical code features are implemented in the pipeline, functions will be incorporated into Preprocess.jl.

<!-- Biomedical data sets are messy! 

, and sources of bias can't always be known without clinical experience.

using medical codes to cluster the data so we get smaller, more efficient DataFrames with less class imbalance.
